## 📦 Packet Drift

Packet Drift is a 2-player, grid-based sliding puzzle game inspired by the Inertia puzzle.
A single packet moves across a fixed board, collecting data chunks while avoiding virus nodes.
The human player competes against a CPU that uses a Greedy strategy to maximize immediate score.

## 🎮 Game Rules 

- One shared packet
- Movement allowed in 8 directions (including diagonals)
- Packet slides continuously until it:
    - hits a Hub (stop tile)
    - hits a Firewall (blocked)
    - goes out of bounds
    - lands on a Virus (instant loss)

- 1 Data Chunk = 1 Byte
- Player with the highest bytes at the end wins

## 🤖 CPU Strategy

The CPU uses a Greedy algorithm:
- Simulates all 8 possible directions
- Chooses the move that gives the maximum immediate bytes
- Avoids moves that land on Virus tiles
